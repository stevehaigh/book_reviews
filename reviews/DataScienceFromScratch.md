## Overview ##
A code-first exploration of data science, mainly machine learning, topics. This does *not* cover using popular tools such as SciKit-Learn (but Gruss does reference them a lot), and it's not an introduction to Machine Learning in the academic sense. 

## Audience ##
Software developers with some basic Python who want to learn *how* machine learnign algorithms work. You need some Python skills, and some prior understanding of machine learning algorthims would be very useful.

If you've done a MOOC such as Andrew Ng Coursera course course this book wold be an ideal handbook to help you implement ideas in Python.

## Main Review ##

## Pros ##
Lots of great code samples. IMHO the code is nice, it's *very* terse, but it's a style I like.

## Cons ##
If you are new to Python the code might be hard to read, it's very Pythonic, I like that a lot, others may disagree.

## Summary ##
Great if you are interested in the details. Might not the bok you want if you are plugging data in to SciKIt-Learn, but reading this will leave you better informed as to how these algorithms work under the covers

## Buying ##
It's been out since 2015, bought new it's around £22, second hand copies are available on Amazon from around £16. Kindle version is around £17.
If you have a Safari subscription you can read online.
